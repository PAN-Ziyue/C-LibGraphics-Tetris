# C-LibGraphics-Tetris

This is a **Tetris** game as the final project of Advanced C Programming in ZJU, which is implemented by C language with LibGraphics.

The game is implemented by visual studio on Win10.

**WARNING**: 

1. It is worth noting that the display scope should be set at 125% on Win10, for the graphics library is so outdated that cannot adjust to the display level automatically.
2. The executable file cannot be execrated directly, **must compile & run the whole game in visual studio**. (This is a bug within the graphics library).  

**Tetris** folder is the source folder.
